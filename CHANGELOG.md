### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- **Edited environment variables name**:  Some environment variables have been renamed. Please review your configuration to ensure it remains valid. If any issues arise, it's recommended to reset your configuration and start fresh with the new variable names.

### ‚ú® Added
- **New step for select the media Service**: The first step now allows user to select which media server want to use (Plex or Jellyfin).
- **Real-Time Log Panel with Filters**: Added a real-time log viewing panel with multiple filters (e.g., `INFO`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG`), allowing users to filter and view application logs directly from the UI for better diagnostics.
- **Implemented **: Implemented UI for testing Plex API connections directly from the configuration page.
- **Trailing Slash Handling**: Automatically removes trailing slashes from URLs in Jellyfin, Jellyseer and Plex configurations to ensure consistency and avoid API errors.
- **Unified Seer Management**: Implemented support for both Jellyseer and Overseer under unified variables for easier configuration (`SEER_API_URL`, `SEER_TOKEN`, etc.).
- **Background Image Rotation**: Added dynamic background image rotation in the configuration wizard to improve visual experience.
- **Default Background Images**: Added fallback background images in the wizard until a valid TMDB API Key is provided.
- **Configuration Pre-testing and Pre-authentication**: Automatically checks if configuration (e.g., API keys, URLs) already exists and marks them as validated and authenticated, skipping manual re-testing steps if previously successful.
  
### üöÄ Improved
- **UI Enhancements**: Improved visual feedback in the form of spinners, validation icons, and error handling during API testing for both Jellyfin and Plex.
- **Code Modularization**: Refactored content automation logic into separate classes for Jellyfin and Plex, improving maintainability and readability.

## [1.0.6] - 2024-10-21

### üö® Important
- **Frontend Migration to Vue.js**: The entire frontend has been migrated to Vue.js, allowing for a more dynamic, reactive, and modular interface. The new design enhances usability and simplifies future feature expansions.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Step-Based Interface**: The interface has been completely redesigned to guide users through configuration in a step-by-step wizard format, making the process more intuitive and easier to follow.
- **API Testing**: Added API testing functionality directly in the interface, allowing users to validate TMDB, Jellyseer and Jellyfin API connections before proceeding with configuration.
- **Library Selection for Checks**: Implemented the ability to select specific Jellyfin libraries that will be used for content checks, providing more granular control over what content gets processed.
- **Cron Next Run Time**: Added a feature that displays the remaining time until the next scheduled cron execution, improving transparency and scheduling insights for users.

### üêõ Fixed
- **Cron Execution**: Fixed an issue preventing the cron job from starting correctly.

### üöÄ Improved.
- **Optimized API Efficiency**: Reduced redundant API calls by improving caching mechanisms, particularly during configuration and testing phases.
- **Jellyseer User Selection**: The user selection dropdown now displays only local users.

## [1.0.5] - 2024-10-19
### üö® Important
- **Docker Compose Update**: Volume path is no longer required, and environment variables are no longer needed.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Asynchronous Processing**: The entire codebase has been refactored to support asynchronous operations, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

### üêõ Fixed
- **Worker Timeout**: Resolved an issue where long-running requests caused the worker to be killed.
- **Out of Memory**: Fixed a Docker issue that triggered out-of-memory exceptions and resulted in worker restarts.
- **Cron Execution**: Fixed an issue preventing the cron job from starting correctly.

### üöÄ Improved
- **Docker Performance**: Optimized Docker performance for smoother operation.

## [1.0.4] - 2024-10-17
### Important
- **Approve automatic request**: To have the ability to approve automatic request made by SuggestArr you need to create a new local account in Jellyseer and provide the credential in the web interface or via the docker-compose file.
### Added
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Refactored the `JellyseerClient` and `ContentAutomation` to use asynchronous methods for improved performance, handling media requests concurrently.
- **Caching of Jellyseer Requests**: Implemented caching of all Jellyseer requests upon client initialization, reducing the number of API calls made during the media request verification process.
  
### Fixed
- **Duplicate Requests Prevention**: Resolved an issue where requests for already available content in Jellyseer were being re-requested, optimizing the workflow to skip items that had been previously requested.
- **Duplicate Requests Prevention**: User selection not working as expected. Need to login via user and password to perform request action as a specific user.

### Improved
- **Docker Performance**: Addressed issues where long-running processes in Docker would cause premature termination. Refined the logic to ensure processes complete successfully without interruption.

## [1.0.3] - 2024-10-16 
### Added
- **User Selection**: Added the ability to select a specific Jellyseer user to initiate requests, enabling management and approval of content.
- **Web Interface Redesign**: Completely revamped the web interface for improved user experience and functionality.

## [1.0.2] - 2024-10-16  
### Added  
- **Utility Class**: Introduced `AppUtils` utility class to handle environment loading, worker identification, and welcome message logging. This improves code modularity and reusability.  
- **Worker Identification Enhancement**: Added a new function to identify the last Gunicorn worker based on the highest PID, optimizing the welcome message to be printed only by the last worker.  
- **Welcome Message**: Implemented a clear welcome message to guide users on systems like Unraid, helping them understand what actions to take.  

### Improved  
- **Modularity**: Refactored various utility functions (`is_last_worker`, `load_environment`, `print_welcome_message`) into a dedicated utility class (`AppUtils`), making the codebase more maintainable.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Added a cross-platform method using `psutil` to determine the last worker process, allowing the project to run seamlessly on different operating systems.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-10-15
